# Code to run the model and generate the simulation data

Save all the files in the same folder and run the following codes:

## Simulation 1
- Sim1_Proposed.R (the proposed model)
- Sim1_NoSIAM+Dirichelt.R (SBART without SIAM structure but with a Dirichlet prior)
- Sim1_SIAM+Unif.R (SBART with SIAM stucture but without a Dirichlet prior)

## Simulation 2
- Sim2_Proposed.R (the proposed model)
- Sim2_NoSIAM+Dirichelt.R (SBART without SIAM structure but with a Dirichlet prior)
- Sim2_SIAM+Unif.R (SBART with SIAM stucture but without a Dirichlet prior)
- Sim2_Misspecified.R (the proposed model with a misspecfied SIAM structure)
