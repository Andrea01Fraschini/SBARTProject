# Get started

In order to be able to host our code in GitHub we divided the datased into many parts, therefore before executing the `main.R` file you should execute the python script in helpers folder called `join_AGC_dataset.py`.

# Edit range datased

To put your own dates you can change the dates the `config.R` file in the main folder.
