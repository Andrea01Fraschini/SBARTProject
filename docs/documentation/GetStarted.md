# Getting Started

## Run model

This guide will help you set up and run the code. Follow the steps below:

1. **Set up your environment**: Open the `env_setup.R` file and replace the placeholder path with the actual path to your working directory. 

2. **Install necessary packages**: Run the `install_packages.R` script. This will install all the necessary R packages. Make sure to do this in an R notebook for best results.

3. **Run model**: Open the `main.R` file and run the script.


## Run tests

1. **Set up your environment**: Open the `env_setup_tests.R` file and replace the placeholder path with the actual path to your working directory. 

2. **Update the run.R script**: Open the `run.R` file and replace the placeholder path with the path to your working directory.

3. **Run the tests**: After setting up your environment and installing the packages, you can run the tests to make sure everything is working correctly.

Remember to replace all placeholder paths with actual paths to your working directory. The placeholder paths are just examples and will not work on your machine.
